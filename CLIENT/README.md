Hello, I have a small project in JavaScript. This is my first project and I'm very happy to do it.
This project asks a player some riddles. When he answers, 
the program gives him the total time it took to answer, and the average time for each riddle individually.


- Object-oriented structure using ES6 classes
- Tracks time per riddle and calculates average
- Modular code using ES modules

##exampel runing:

C:\dev\jsNew\Riddles>node app.js>>

Choose difficulty: easy / medium / hard:
easy,
enter yor name!,
Shaya ,
What is 10 - 4?

hello pleyr: Shaya

look of your information:
the total time is: 13592 seconds
the average of answer one riddle is:6796 seconds


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `app.js` in your terminal
3. Answer the riddles and see your stats!

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js (optional for running with modules locally)
